### Welcome!

In past, various powerful numerical methods in scientific computing field has been invented. Nowadays, many interesting challenges have been proposed in the big-data era, including high dimensional data analysis, large-scale computing and optimization.  

I am a **mathematician** who wants to contribute to connecting the bridge between them and shedding light on both sides. 



### About me

I am a second year phd student at the Emory university, working with <a href="mathcs.emory.edu/~yxi26/" target="_blank">Yuanzhe Xi</a>. My interest focuses on applying scientific computing techniques to solve problems in data science and deep learning. My collaborators include <a href="https://hehuannb.github.io/" target="_blank">Huan He</a>, <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~echow/" target="_blank">Professor Edmond Chow</a> at Georgia Institute of Technology, <a href="https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~saad/" target="_blank">Professor Yoursef Saad</a> at University of Minnesota.
Previously, I was a MPhil student at the <a href="https://hkust.edu.hk/" target="_blank">The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a> (HKUST) (2018-2020) and a undergraduate student at <a href="https://en.whu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Wuhan University</a> (WHU) (2014-2018).
